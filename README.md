# unit-4-game

**Here's how the app works:**

**1.** _There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page._

**2.** _The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game._

**3.** _When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score._

**4.** _Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal._
       _When they do click one, update the player's score counter._
       _The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game._

**5.** _The player loses if their score goes above the random number._

**6.** _The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses._

**7.** _When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of         course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
        The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the           game._

**Game design notes**

**1.** _The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120._

**2.** _Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12._
